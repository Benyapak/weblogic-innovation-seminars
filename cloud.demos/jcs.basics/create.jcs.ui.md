### About this tutorial ###
This tutorial demonstrates how to:
	
+ create Java Cloud Service using the user interface.

### Steps ###

[Sign in](sign.in.to.oracle.cloud.md) and navigate to the dashboard. On the dashboard click on the hamburger icon on the Java tile. Select Open Service Console.

Select subscription type. Select the fully managed Oracle Java Cloud Service and the desired billing format. For more details about subscription types see the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/jcs_gs/JSCUG/GUID-31F00F2C-221F-4069-8E8A-EE48BFEC53A2.htm#JSCUG-GUID-98DD6CE1-480F-4AA9-8131-A1D3D274440F).

When creating a database deployment Oracle Java Cloud Service, the following Oracle WebLogic editions are available:

Select Enterprise Edition.

The last input page is the Service Details page. The following parameters have to be provided:
	
+ Service Name: the name of the service instance e.g. techco
+ Shape: number of OCPU and size of the RAM. Choose the smallest (default) one.
+ SSH Public Key: public key which will be uploaded to the VM during the creation. It allows to connect to the VM through ssh connection using the private key. Use the same publicKey what was generated for Database Cloud Service instance. Click on Edit button and select previously saved `/u01/content/weblogic-innovation-seminars/cloud.demos/publicKey`. You can also copy the content of publicKey into Key Value field. If you don't have or want to  to create different keypair select Create a New Key option and download the newly generated keypair for later usage.

+ Enable Administration Console: this instance will be available on public internet, thus the default is not enable WebLogic Admin console availability.
+ Username: username of WebLogic administrator. For demo purposes use: weblogic
+ Password: WebLogic administrator's password. Don't forget to note the provided password.
+ Deploy Sample Application: deploy the sample application. It can be useful to test accessibility (correct LB configuration, etc.) of the Java Cloud Service Instance.
+ Database Configuration / Name: Database Cloud Service name to store WebLogic repository data. Basically the list populated with database services within the same identity domain.
+ Database Configuration / PDB Name: pluggable database service identifier of the Database Cloud Service instance -provided above- which will be used to store repository schema.
+ Database Configuration / Administrator User Name: DBA admin to create repository schema for Java Cloud Service instance. Usually it is: sys.
+ Database Configuration / Password: DBA admin password.
+ Database Configuration / For Application Schema: It is an option to add different database service instance accessibility. For example different database used by the application and different for Java Cloud Service instance repository. You can configure later another Database Cloud Service, but here it is easier to define.
+ Provision Load Balancer: the save resources for sample application we will not create Load Balancer instance.
+ Cloud Storage Container: the name of the container for Database Cloud Service instance. The format is the following: Storage-IDENTITYDOMAIN/CONTAINERNAME. The container don't need to be created in advance, because -see below- there is an option to create automatically. Now give the same container what you provided (created) earlier for Database Cloud Service instance.
+ Cloud Storage User Name and Password: the credentials for storage. Usually it is the same what was used to sign in to Oracle Cloud Services.
+ Create Cloud Storage Containers: if the container defined above does not exist then check in.

For more details about parameters see the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/jcs_gs/JSCUG/GUID-31F00F2C-221F-4069-8E8A-EE48BFEC53A2.htm#JSCUG-GUID-88BD737C-8DA9-419A-8DBF-489BDFF9C512). Click on Next.

The final page is the summary about the configuration before submit the instance creation request. Click on Create to start the provisioning of the new service instance.
